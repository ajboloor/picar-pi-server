# picar-pi-server
Small crash course on setting up and using the Raspberry Pi (as a server, ftp storage, home-base, etc.)

### What is a Raspberry Pi?
A [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) is a credit card sized computer that can run Linux (and other OS) to do almost anything your computer can do. It can be simply connected to a monitor/TV, keyboard and mouse and be used as a regular computer. Because of its low power consumption, it is used as a web-server, file storage system, home automation system, etc. It can also be connected to an Arduino to aid in robotics such as the PiCar.

### Setting it up
##### What you need:
- Raspberry Pi 3 B+ (older models will also work)
- Pi compatible power adapter
- Micro SD Card (with alteast 16GB of memory; you may need an SD card adapter to connect it to your computer) 
- USB keyboard and mouse
- Access to a monitor + HDMI cable
- Access to your router, or a new router

##### Steps:
1. Download the [RASPBIAN STRETCH WITH DESKTOP](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) image.
2. Download [Etcher](https://etcher.io/)
3. Install Raspbian OS to the Raspberry Pi:
    * Insert SD card into your computer. 
    * Run Etcher. 
    * In Etcher, choose the downloaded Raspbian zip or image file. 
    * Choose the SD Card (note: please be very careful to choose the correct drive, it will be formatted). 
    * Flash the image. 
    * Eject SD card and put it into the Raspberry Pi. 
4. Connect the mouse, keyboard and monitor to the Raspberry Pi. Finally connect the power cable to turn on the Raspberry Pi.


5. The default login credentials for the Raspberry Pi
